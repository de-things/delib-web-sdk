## Pre-requirements
You need to install `NodeJS` runtime for JavaScript execution.

## Usage
Install server dependencies running in terminal a command below:

```
npm i
```

...then use `node server.js` or `bun server.js` depending on your js runtime.

This is an example server to handle two type of delib requests for ethernet and wlan profiles. They work a little bit different to each other, so yea... Why do you need this data actually...🐳
