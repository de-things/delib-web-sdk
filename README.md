## Usage
Create any TS/JS web project (frontend/backend, I don't mind) and clone `delib.js` into the somewhere. Then create a `DelibDevice` class instance to communicate with your de:things devices based on **[delib](https://github.com/de-things/delib)** serverside.

You can check **[./tests/](./tests)** directory to understand, how it works in frontend, using a local `expressjs` server.
